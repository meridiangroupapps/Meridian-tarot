🧠 Philosophy

Meridian Tarot is part of a mythic app constellation designed to feel inevitable and premium — even when free. It offers just enough structure to support intuitive interpretation, without crowding the user with pre-written summaries or forced symbolism.

This app reflects the worldview of a professional tarot reader:  
- Trust the cards  
- Trust the user  
- Keep the interface out of the way
